# webnoise_glua_cakes
an repository of maybe useful cakes for gLua. I don't think i need to do documentation for my cakes, if you need my cake, then you will definitely understand how it works :) (to be honest, sometimes i don't understand how it works by myself)

# cl_emotesbttv.lua
cake that will help download emotes from BTTV channels, based on EasyChat by Earu.
